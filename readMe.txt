ReadMe File
==============================================

The java program files are named as 
ClosestPair.java: Tests all the three algorithms, and has the provision to switch the type of distribution
Point: Contains the class which implements points
randomGeneration: Contains the methods for different distribution
StopWatch: contains class for stop watch to time the execution
NaiveNForce: Contains method for brute force algorithm

The code is easily customizable. You can make changes in the closestPair.java file to test it thoroughly. The starting
number of points are 64 and the power is 6. If you want to test for 128 points you need to change the noOfPointsvariable to 128 and power to 7.

=====================================================================================================
Reading Graphs:
The name of the file is "empirical analysis 1". 
=====================================================================================================

--------------------
Random Distribution:
--------------------
This graph can be found in the sheet 1 of empirical analysis file. It contains analysis of all the three algorithms whose
points are distributed randomly.

------------------------
Hexagonal Distribution:
------------------------
This graph is made in MS Excel and can be found in sheet 2 of the file. It contains analysis of all the three algorithms whose
points are distributed in hexagonal fashion.

--------------------------
Mixed Distribution:
--------------------------
This graph is made in MS Excel and can be found in sheet 3 of the file. It contains analysis of all the three algorithms whose
5% points are distributed randomly and rest distributed hexagonally.

------------------------------------
Comparison for individual algorithms
------------------------------------
This is sheet 4 and it contains the graphs of individual algorithms. It shows the behavior of the three algorithms in different 
distribution.

===========
Execution:
===========
Just execute the ClosestPair.java file as it tests all the algorithms at once. It will also give you the average execution time.
What values corresponds to waht time is commented in the file. Please see that.
You can comment and uncomment code based on what you want to test.

========================================================================================================
The technical explaination of the graphs and readings can be found in the file named "techAnalysis".
